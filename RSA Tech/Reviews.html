                        If you’re a technology nerd, enthusiast or your contract is
                        about to expire and thinking about upgrading. You have sure
                        heard that Samsung have recently( as they do every year)
                        released the new S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra as their new Flagship
                        devices. In this article we will be focussing on the S20 as it
                        is the direct descendant of the previous line in almost every
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Samsung did not fail to reach for the skies when the conjured
                        the specs for this particular device. The Samsung S20 boost a
                        significant improvement in all aspects including but not limited to
                        screen, camera, processors and battery.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The S20 boosts a 6.2” Quad HD (3200*1440p) OLED panel that as usual
                        will most likely be the best screen you can get on a smartphone for
                        the next 12 months. Additionally the screen runs at a blistering
                        120 Hz enabling instantaneous response to your every touch no matter
                        how slight. They further doubled the touch response so as to make the
                        entire experience. However, the phone comes by default at 60 Hz
                        running at 1440p resolution and can only reach the 120hz if set to
                        1080p. The screen is made from Gorilla glass 6 resulting in less
                        susceptibility to scratches and drops.

                        The new flagship will be using the New Exynnos 990 processing core,
                        which is said to be as fast as, or close to the Snapdragon 865.
                        This mean the devices will as expected be very snappy in daily
                        operations and mobile gaming. Although the 990 is based on
                        architecture from the previous year (ARM Cortex A76) the difference
                        would miniscule and unnoticed by many users. The processor will be
                        adequately utilised as the S20 will have 8gb of ram and 128gb of
                        internal space.

                        Camera have recently become one of if not the most
                        important feature for many users. In this respect Samsung is not
                        disappoint. There are 3 cameras in the back and 1 selfie camera
                        through the infinity O display. The back has a 12mp main camera
                        at f1.8, a 64mp telephoto lens at f2.0 and a 12mp wide lens at
                        f2.2. All sensor are bigger from the previous year and definitely
                        will improve low light photos. It further has 30x software zoom
                        and 10x optical zoom with added zoom related improvement to the
                        camera app. The selfie camera is a 10mp sensor at f/2.2The S20
                        is also capable of 8k video quality which is guaranteed to
                        satisfy videographers and vloggers alike.Other improvement include
                        the now larger battery at 4000mAh and a fast charger. With a
                        flatter screen and no native Bixby button and under screen
                        fingerprint sensor and again no headphone jack.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        If one considers the 120hz and the improvements all across the board
                        it will make this device a contender in the flagship market even
                        though it will cost R18 999.00 to own.
