	<p>	In 1900, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinunge
		n" ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the
		journal Annalen der Physik.[56][57] On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed 
		his thesis,[58] with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, 
		serving as pro-forma advisor. As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by 
		the University of Zürich, with his dissertation "A New Determination of 
		Molecular Dimensions".
	</p>
	<p>	In that same year, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year),
		he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian 
		motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which 
		were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.
	</p>
	<p>	By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer 
		at the University of Bern. The following year, after giving a lecture on 
		electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zürich, 
		Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship 
		in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.
