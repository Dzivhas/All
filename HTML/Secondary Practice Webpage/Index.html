			<h1>A Brief Summary of the life and achievements of Albert...</h1>

			<p> Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist, although most people probably
				know him as the most intelligent person who ever lived.His name has become
				part of many languages when we want to say someone is a genius, as in the
				phrase, �She�s a real Einstein�.He must have been pretty brainy to discover
				the Theory of Relativity and the equation E=mc2.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1999, �Time� magazine named Einstein as the Person of the Century. No one
				could have guessed this would happen when he was at school.He was extremely
				interested in science but hated the system of learning by heart. He said it
				destroyed learning and creativity.He had already done many experiments, but
				failed the entrance exams to a technical college.He didn�t let this setback
				stop him. When he was 16, he performed his famous experiment of imagining
				traveling alongside a beam of light.He eventually graduated from university,
				in 1900, with a degree in physics. Twelve years later he was a university
				professor and in 1921,he won the Nobel Prize for Physics. He went on to
				publish over 300 scientific papers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Einstein is the only scientist to become a cult figure, a household name, and
				part of everyday culture.He once joked that when people stopped him in the street,
				he always replied: "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.�
				Today, he is seen as the typical mad, absent-minded professor, who just happened
				to change our world.
