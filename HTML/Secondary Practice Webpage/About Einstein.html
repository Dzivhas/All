	<p>	Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg 
		in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879.His parents were Hermann Einstein, 
		a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, 
		where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. 
		Einstein & Cie,a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on 
		direct current.

	<p>	The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended 
		a Catholic elementary school in Munich,from the age of 5, for three years.
		At the age of 8, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium 
		(now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced 
		primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire 
		seven years later.

	<p>	In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich 
		with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment 
		from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) 
		standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, 
		the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. 
		When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to 
		finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to 
		pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with authorities 
		and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote 
		that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict
		rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join 
		his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.
		During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the 
		title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".
