	<p>	In his travel diaries from his 1922-23 visit to Asia, he expresses 
		xenophobic and racist judgments on the Chinese, Japanese and 
		Indian people he saw.[113]Einstein joined National Association 
		for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where 
		he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans. He considered
		racism America's "worst disease,"seeing it as "handed down from one 
		B.Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 
		1951.[115]:565 When Einstein offered to be a character witness for 
		Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.

	<p>	In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically
		black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. (Lincoln was the 
		first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African 
		Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall.) Einstein 
		gave a speech about racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet 
		about it."[117] A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid 
		the college tuition for a black student.

	<p>	Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism,
		which he detailed in his essays such as "Why Socialism?".[130][131] Einstein 
		offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often 
		unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.[96] He strongly advocated 
		the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of 
		nation-states in the framework of a world federation.[132] The FBI created a
		secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file 
		was 1,427 pages long.
